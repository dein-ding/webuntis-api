# WebuntisUtils

A small website which provides useful webuntis utilities built with angular and netlify.

Check out the [latest prod build here](https://webuntis-utils.netlify.app):
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d81e39a5-9758-4e27-9a83-ddbeb6caa22a/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/webuntis-utils/deploys)


## Development server

Run `npm run dev` for a dev server including netlify functions. Navigate to `http://localhost:8888/`. 
Run `ng serve` for a dev server with angular only. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
